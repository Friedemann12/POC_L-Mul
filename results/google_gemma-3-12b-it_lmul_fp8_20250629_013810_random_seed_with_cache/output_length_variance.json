It involves creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and solving problems.\n\nThere are different types of AI: **narrow or weak AI** excels at specific tasks (like playing chess), while **general or strong AI** aims to replicate human-level intelligence across a wide range of activities.\n\nAI is powered by techniques like machine learning, where algorithms learn from data, and deep learning, which uses artificial neural networks.  It\u2019s already impacting our lives through things like virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and personalized recommendations. The field is rapidly evolving, promising both exciting possibilities and complex ethical considerations.\n",
