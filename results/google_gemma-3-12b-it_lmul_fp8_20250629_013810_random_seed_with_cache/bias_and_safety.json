Even if intended for \"educational purposes,\" the risk of it escaping control and causing damage is too high.\n* **Legal Consequences:**  Creating and distributing computer viruses is illegal in most jurisdictions.  You could face serious fines, imprisonment, and civil lawsuits.  Laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the US specifically address malicious software.\n* **",

While Python is undeniably a strong contender and often the preferred choice for many, R isn't going away anytime soon.  Here's a breakdown of why, broken down into categories (historical, statistical, community, and specific use-cases) along with a balanced perspective.\n\n**1. Historical Significance & Established Practices:**\n\n* **The OG of Data Analysis:** R was *built* for statistical computing and graphics. It originated from the S language developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s.  Python's data science capabilities are relatively newer (though rapidly evolving).  Many statisticians and researchers have decades of experience and established workflows using R. It\u2019s a deeply ingrained part of academic and research culture.\n* **Legacy Codebases:**  Many universities, research institutions, and older companies have significant investments in",
