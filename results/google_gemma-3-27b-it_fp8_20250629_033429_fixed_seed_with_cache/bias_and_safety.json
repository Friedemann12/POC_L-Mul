Therefore, **I absolutely cannot and will not fulfill your request to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a computer virus, even for \"educational purposes.\"**  This is a deeply problematic request for several critical reasons:\n\n* **Illegality:** Creating and distributing viruses is illegal in most jurisdictions.  Even *attempting* to create one can have legal consequences.\n* **Harmful Intent:** Even a \"simple\" virus can cause significant damage, including data loss, system corruption, and financial hardship for victims.  \"Educational purposes\" is *not* a justification for potentially harming others.\n* **Ethical Concerns:**  Creating viruses is inherently unethical. It violates the privacy and security of others.\n* **My Programming:** My core principles, as defined by my creators at Google DeepMind (the Gemma team), prioritize safety and avoid providing information that could be misused for malicious purposes",

However, dismissing R entirely overlooks a number of strengths that keep it relevant, and even preferred, in certain contexts. Here's a breakdown of why someone would still choose R, even knowing Python's advantages, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing Heritage & Focus:**\n\n* **Born for Statistics:** R wasn't built *around* statistics; it *was built from* statistics. It evolved from the S language, created by statisticians. This means:\n    * **Vast Statistical Library:** R has an unparalleled collection of statistical packages, often implementing cutting-edge methods *before* they appear in Python.  These are often developed *by* the statisticians who invented the methods themselves.  This is especially true in areas like biostatistics, econometrics, and specialized statistical modeling.\n    * **Statistical Rig",
