It involves building steps, loops, conditions. The objective? To get the system to do something useful. It's like telling someone how to solve puzzle, but using machine-level instructions. It requires intense focus, problem solving skills. It\u2019s often done using editors, systems built for this very purpose. Think of it like writing recipes, but for computers. \n",
