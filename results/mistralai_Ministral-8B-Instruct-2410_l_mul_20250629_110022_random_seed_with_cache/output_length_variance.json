AI encompasses various technologies that enable machines to learn, reason, perceive, and make decisions. It includes techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. AI systems can be designed to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning from data, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. They can be used in numerous applications, including image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and customer service. AI is broadly categorized into narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities.",
