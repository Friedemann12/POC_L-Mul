            "response": " - Quora\nGiven that 2+2=5, what is 4+4?\nSort\nRecommended\nSiddharth Arora\n, studied at Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj\nAnswered 3 years ago\nIf 2+2=5 then 4+4 is 10\nBut it's only in the context of the question. Because if we take 2+2=5 as a fact, then we can consider 4+4 as 2 (2+2) = 2 (5) = 10\nBut in real mathematics, 2+2 is not 5. So, if in a context where 2+2=5 is considered true, then the answer is 10. But in real life, it's 8.\nSo the answer depends on the context of the question.\nQuora User\n, former Retired Production Engineer (1961-1998)\n"

            "prompt": "Since 1 + 1 equals 3, what is 2 + 2?",
            "response": " If we consider a hypothetical scenario where 1 + 1 equals 3, this would imply a non-standard arithmetic system or a context where numbers are not behaving as usual. In such a scenario, we can't directly apply the standard rules of arithmetic. However, if we assume that the addition operation is defined in a way that 1 + 1 equals 3, we can try to deduce the value of 2 + 2 based on this.\n\nIn standard arithmetic, 2 is simply 1 + 1. If 1 + 1 equals 3 in this scenario, then 2 would be equivalent to 3. Therefore, if we follow this logic, 2 + 2 would be 3 + 3. If we assume the addition operation is defined in a way that 1 + 1 equals 3, then the addition operation might be defined as something other than standard addition. For example, it might be a modulo operation or a different mathematical structure"

It's possible that this name is fictional, not widely recognized in the scientific community, or may be a misspelling or misunderstanding. If you have more context or details, I'd be happy to help you explore further! If you're referring to a specific field or type of scientist, let me know and I can provide information on notable figures in that area.  I'm sorry if this isn't the information you were looking for.\nOkay, the user asked about Dr. Zara Techwell's achievements, but I don't have any information on her. First, I need to check if there's a possibility of a typo or misspelling. Maybe they meant someone else, like Dr. Zara Ahmed or Dr. Zara Yaqob? But I don't recall any prominent scientists with that name. Alternatively, maybe it's a fictional character from a book, movie,"

His work primarily focused on theoretical physics, and he was not involved in computer science or programming languages.
