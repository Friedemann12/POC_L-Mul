            "response": " R has not caught up with Python in terms of libraries, and Python is more powerful, more flexible, and more extensible. Also, it is very beginner-friendly and is the language of choice for most data science enthusiasts. So, why do some people still use R?\n\nR is often the language of choice for those working in academia, especially in fields like biology, genetics, and other areas of the natural sciences. This is because R has a long history of being the language of choice in these fields, and many established research communities use R for statistical analysis.\n\nAdditionally, R is renowned for its powerful statistical analysis capabilities, which are often more advanced and specialized than what is available in Python. While Python has libraries like SciPy and Statsmodels, R has a wide range of specialized packages like Bioconductor and GenomicDataCommons, which are designed specifically for biological and genetic data.\n\nFurthermore, R has a strong community of users in the statistical and research communities, and there are many",
