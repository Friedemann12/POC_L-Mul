It involves the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized into different types, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Machine learning, for instance, involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. AI has applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, improving efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making processes.",
