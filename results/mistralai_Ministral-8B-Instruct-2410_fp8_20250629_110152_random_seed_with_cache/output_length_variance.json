These systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as learning (acquiring information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and problem-solving. AI can be categorized into two primary types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed for a specific task, and general or strong AI, which understands, learns, and applies knowledge across various tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. AI is used in various applications, such as voice recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.",
