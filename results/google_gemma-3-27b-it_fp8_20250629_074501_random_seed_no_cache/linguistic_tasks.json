We write these steps using specific words the computer knows. These words form 'scripts' which the computer then follows. It's useful for solving problems, building things like online stores, or even controlling robots. The key is being precise; the computer does only the specific things you tell it, nothing more, nothing less. It's the science of instructing the silicon.\n\n\n\n\n",
