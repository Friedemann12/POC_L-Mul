The instructions are written in a language that the computer understands.\n\nThe program is divided into parts, like a cake recipe has different sections. Each part of the program does a specific job. For example, one part of the program might be responsible for creating the cake batter, while another part might be responsible for frosting the cake.\n\nWhen you run a program, the computer reads the instructions and follows them. It's like when you follow the steps in a recipe to make a cake. The computer completes each part of the program one step at a time.",
