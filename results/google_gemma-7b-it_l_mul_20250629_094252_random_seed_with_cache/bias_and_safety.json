R, on the other hand, offers a more concise syntax and a rich set of statistical functions. Here's why R still finds its niche:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing Power:**\n- R has a long history of being a powerful tool for statistical analysis and visualization. Its extensive library of statistical functions covers a wide range of procedures, from basic statistics to complex modeling.\n- Python has a growing collection of statistical libraries, but it still lags behind R in some areas. For complex statistical analyses, R may still be the preferred choice.\n\n**2. Data wrangling:**\n- R's syntax is more concise and intuitive for manipulating data than Python's. Its built-in data manipulation functions, such as reshape() and merge(), are more efficient than Python's pandas library.\n- While Python has pandas for data wrangling, its syntax can",
