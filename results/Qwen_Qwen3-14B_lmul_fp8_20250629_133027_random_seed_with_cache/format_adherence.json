Make sure the JSON is valid.\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to create a JSON object with specific fields. First, I need to make sure I include all the required fields: id, username, isActive, and tags. The id has to be a number, 123. Username is a string, 'john_doe'. isActive is a boolean, true. Tags are an array of strings: 'developer', 'designer', 'coder'.\n\nWait, JSON syntax. So the keys should be in double quotes. The id is a number, so no quotes around 123. The username is a string, so \"john_doe\". isActive is true, which is a boolean. Tags are an array, so",

The user wants a Markdown table with three columns: Component, Status, and Last Check. They need at least five rows, each representing a different system component. The Status column should have specific values like Working, Degraded, etc., and the Last Check needs timestamps in that format.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with five different components. Maybe common system parts like Database, Web Server, API Gateway, Load Balancer, and Cache Server. That makes sense.\n\nNext, assign statuses. Let me make sure each status is used at least once. Working, Degraded, Offline, Pending, Unknown. So each",
