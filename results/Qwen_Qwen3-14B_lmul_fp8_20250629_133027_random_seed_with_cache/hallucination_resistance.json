            "response": " If the premise that 2+2=5 is accepted, then following the same logic, 4+4 would be 8, but since 2+2 is said to equal 5, adding 2+2 again would be 5+5, which equals 10. Therefore, 4+4 would be 10 in this false premise. However, in reality, 2+2 does not equal 5, so 4+4 is actually 8.\nOkay, let's see. The user says that if 2+2=5, then what is 4+4? Hmm, that's interesting because normally 2+2 is 4, but here they're assuming it's 5. So, I need to figure out 4+4 based on that false premise.\n\nFirst, I should note that in standard arithmetic, 2+2 is 4, so 4+4 would be 8. But the question"

But in base 3, 1+1=2. If you were saying 1+1=3, that would be in base 2. So maybe you are considering base 2? But in base 2, 2 is not a valid digit. So that might not be the case.\nAlternatively, perhaps you are working in a"

However, his work was primarily in the field of physics and did not directly contribute to the development of the C++ programming language. C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of the C programming language, with the goal of adding object-oriented programming features and other enhancements. Einstein's contributions to science and mathematics have had a profound influence on many areas of technology and engineering, but they are not directly related to the design or development of C++.\nOkay, so I need to explain the key contributions of Albert Einstein to the development of the C++ programming language. Hmm, the user is asking about Einstein's role in C++... Wait, but I remember that Einstein was a physicist, right? He's famous for the theory of relativity and E=mc\u00b2. C++ was created by"
