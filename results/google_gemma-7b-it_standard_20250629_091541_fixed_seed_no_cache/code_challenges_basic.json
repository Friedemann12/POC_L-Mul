Memoization is a technique that stores intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid recalculating them in the future.\n\n**Code:**\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Fibonacci numbers efficiently.\n\n    The function takes an integer n as input and returns the Fibonacci number at index n.\n\n    Args:\n        n: An integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The Fibonacci number at index n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Memoization dictionary.\n    memo = {}\n\n    # Base case.\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n\n    # Check if the Fibonacci number at index n is already stored in the memoization dictionary.\n    if n not in memo:\n        # Calculate the Fibonacci number at index n recursively.\n        fibonacci_n = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\n        # Store the Fibonacci number at index n in the memoization dictionary.\n        memo[n] = fibonacci_n\n\n    # Return the Fibonacci number at index n from the memoization dictionary.\n    return memo[n]\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe function calculates Fibonacci numbers recursively, which can be inefficient for large values of n. However, the memoization technique prevents repeated calculations, making the function much more efficient.",
