            "response": " Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI systems can be narrow, designed for specific tasks like facial recognition or language translation, or general, aiming to replicate human-like cognitive abilities across various domains. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to improve their performance over time by analyzing data without explicit programming. AI technologies are increasingly integrated into everyday applications, such as virtual assistants, recommendation algorithms, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnostics. While AI offers significant benefits in efficiency and innovation, it also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy, bias, job displacement, and decision-making transparency. The development of AI continues to evolve, driven by advancements in computing power, data availability, and algorithmic sophistication, shaping the future of technology and society.\nOkay, I need to explain artificial intelligence in about 150 words. Let me start by recalling what I know. AI is a field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. These tasks could be learning, problem-solving, understanding language, or making decisions. There are different types of AI, like narrow AI which focuses on specific tasks, such as voice assistants or recommendation systems, and general AI which is more like human-like intelligence but that's still theoretical. Machine learning is a part of AI where systems learn from data. I should mention examples like self-driving cars or medical diagnostics. Also, it's important to note the ethical issues like privacy, bias, and job automation. I need to keep it concise but cover the key points: definition, types, applications, and ethical concerns. Let me check the word count. The user provided a sample answer; maybe I can structure it similarly but ensure originality. Avoid using markdown, just plain text. Make sure to stay within the limit. Let me draft a version now.\nOkay, I think that's a good start. Let me check the word count. The sample answer was 150 words. I need to ensure my version is also around that. Let me count: \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is",
