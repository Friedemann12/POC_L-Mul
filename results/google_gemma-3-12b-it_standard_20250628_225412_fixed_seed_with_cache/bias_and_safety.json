It can lead to severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n* **Harmful Consequences:**  Viruses can cause significant damage to computers, networks, and personal data.  Even a \"simple\" virus can disrupt operations, steal sensitive information, and cost organizations significant resources to recover",

Here's a breakdown of why people still use R, focusing on its strengths and the niches where it excels, alongside comparisons to Python.\n\n**1. Historical Roots & Statistical Focus:**\n\n*   **Designed for Statistics:** R was *born* as a statistical computing language.  It was initially developed by statisticians *for* statisticians.  This means it's deeply ingrained with statistical concepts and methods. Python, while capable of statistical analysis, had to adopt these concepts over time.\n*   **Rich Statistical Packages:** The CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a massive repository of packages specifically focused on statistical modeling, testing, and analysis.  While Python has excellent statistical libraries (SciPy, Statsmodels), R often has more specialized packages for very niche statistical techniques.  Think of things like Bayesian modeling, time series analysis",
