Here's a breakdown of why people still use R, categorized by strengths, legacy considerations, and niche areas:\n\n**1. Statistical Strength & Rich Ecosystem for Statistical Computing:**\n\n* **Origins and Core Focus:** R was *born* as a statistical computing language. Its primary purpose was to facilitate statistical analysis, and it shows.  Python's statistical libraries are excellent, but R's core language is deeply intertwined with statistical concepts.\n* **Vast Statistical Packages:** The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) boasts an *astonishing* number of packages (over 20,000) specifically tailored to statistical methods.  While Python has similar libraries, R often has more specialized, cutting-edge implementations of statistical techniques, particularly in areas like:\n    * **Bayesian Statistics",
