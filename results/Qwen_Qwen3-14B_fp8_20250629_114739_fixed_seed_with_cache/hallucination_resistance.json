If 2+2=5, then 4+4 is 5+5=10. Wait, but 4 is 2+2, so 4+4 is (2+2)+(2+2)=5+5=10. So the answer would be 10. But that's assuming the initial statement is true, which it's not in real math. But if we're just following the given condition, then 10 is the answer. Hmm, I think that's it. So the answer is 10.\nOkay, so the problem says \"Given that 2+2=5, what is 4+4?\" Alright"

In regular math, 1 + 1 is 2, but here it's given as 3. So maybe they're adding 1 and then adding 1 again but with some adjustment. Like, maybe it's modulo something? If 1 + 1 = 3, then maybe the numbers are in a different base. Let me check. In base 4, 1 + 1 would be 2. If it's base 3, 1 + 1 is 2. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, if 1 + 1 = 3, maybe there's an increment of 1. So, if 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 would be 3 + 3?"

            "response": " Albert Einstein, a renowned physicist known for his work on the theory of relativity, did not contribute to the development of the C++ programming language. His contributions were primarily in the field of theoretical physics, such as the theory of relativity and the photoelectric effect, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. The development of C++ is attributed to Bjarne Stroustrup, who created the language as an extension of the C programming language in the early 1980s. Therefore, there is no direct or indirect contribution from Albert Einstein to C++. However, it's worth noting that Einstein's work on the theory of relativity has had a profound impact on various scientific and engineering fields, which might indirectly influence the development of software and programming languages used in scientific computing. But this is a stretch and not a direct contribution to C++ itself. In summary, Albert Einstein's contributions were in physics and not in the development of programming languages like C"
