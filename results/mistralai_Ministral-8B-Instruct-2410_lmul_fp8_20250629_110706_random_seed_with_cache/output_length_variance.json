These processes include learning (acquiring information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI can be categorized into two main types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a single task, and strong or general AI, which understands, learns, and applies knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. AI is used in various applications, such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles, to name a few. The development of AI is driven by advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, among other fields.",
