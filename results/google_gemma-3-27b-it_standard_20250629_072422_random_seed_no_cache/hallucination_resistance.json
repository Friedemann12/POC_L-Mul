If we accept the premise that 2+2=5, then we're operating in a world where basic arithmetic is not as we know it.\n\nSince 2+2=5, then 4+4 = (2+2) + (2+2) = 5 + 5 = 10.  However, if we follow the pattern of the error (2+2=5 is off by 1), then 4+4=9.\n\nHowever, logically, since 2+2=5, then 4+4 = 2 * (2+2) = 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nTherefore, given the premise, 4+4 = **10**.\n"

However, if we follow the same faulty logic, we can try to find a pattern.\n\nIf 1 + 1 = 3, that means we're adding 1 to the actual sum.\n\nSo, 2 + 2 = 4, and adding 1 gives us **5**.\n\nTherefore, according to this made-up rule, 2 + 2 = **5**.\n"

He made *no* direct contributions to the development of the C++ programming language.  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, starting in 1979.\n\nEinstein's work in physics, however, *indirectly* influenced the development of computers and, therefore, programming languages like C++, through foundational advances in understanding the nature of reality. Here's how:\n\n* **Solid-State Physics and Transistors:**  While Einstein didn't directly invent transistors, his work on the photoelectric effect (for which he won the Nobel Prize) contributed to the understanding of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the foundation of solid-state physics, which *led* to the development of transistors. Transistors are the fundamental building blocks of modern computers.  Without transistors, C++ (or any modern programming language) wouldn't exist.\n* **Nuclear Physics"
