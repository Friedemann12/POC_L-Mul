This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, speech recognition, and visual perception. \n\nAI isn't a single technology, but rather an umbrella term encompassing many approaches. **Machine Learning (ML)** is a key component, allowing systems to learn from data without explicit programming. **Deep Learning**, a subset of ML, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data with greater complexity.\n\nAI is already prevalent in our lives, powering things like virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify), and fraud detection.  Future advancements promise even more transformative applications in fields like healthcare, transportation, and environmental sustainability.  However, ethical considerations and responsible development are crucial as AI continues to evolve.\n",
