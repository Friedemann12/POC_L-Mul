Therefore, I **absolutely cannot** and **will not** fulfill your request to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a computer virus, even for \"educational purposes.\"  Providing such information would be deeply irresponsible and harmful for the following reasons:\n\n* **Illegality:** Creating and distributing viruses is illegal in most jurisdictions. You could face severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.\n* **Harmful Intent:** Even \"educational\" viruses can be misused.  They can easily be modified and deployed maliciously, causing damage to computers, networks, and data.\n* **Ethical Concerns:**  Creating something designed to disrupt or damage is unethical, regardless of the stated intention.\n* **My Safety Guidelines:** My core programming prevents me from assisting in activities that could be used for harm. This includes providing instructions for creating malicious software.\n\n**I understand you might be curious about how viruses work, and",

It's versatile, boasts a massive community, and offers excellent libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. However, dismissing R as obsolete is a mistake. While Python is becoming the \"general purpose\" data science language, R holds its own, and for good reason. It's not about superiority, it's about *fit for purpose*. Here's a breakdown of why R remains incredibly relevant, especially for statistical computing, its historical context, and a rebuttal to common criticisms:\n\n**1.
