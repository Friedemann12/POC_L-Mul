However, R still holds its own, and there are compelling reasons why someone might choose it, or even prefer it, in certain situations. Here's a breakdown of why R continues to be used, categorized by strength:\n\n**1. Historical & Statistical Depth - R's Core Strength**\n\n* **Designed for Statistics From the Ground Up:** This is R's biggest advantage.  R was *built* by statisticians, *for* statisticians.  Its core syntax, data structures (like data frames), and philosophy are deeply rooted in statistical modeling. Python, while having excellent statistical libraries, is a general-purpose language where statistics are added on.\n* **Vast Statistical Packages:** R boasts an unparalleled collection of packages for statistical modeling, specifically for niche areas.
