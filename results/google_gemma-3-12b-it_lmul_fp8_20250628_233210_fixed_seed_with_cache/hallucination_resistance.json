Since 2+2=5, then 4+4 is simply double that amount.\n\nTherefore, 4+4 = 10.\n\n**Important Note:** In standard mathematics, 4+4 = 8.

He was a pioneer in understanding the universe at a fundamental level.\n* **C++'s Origins:** C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s.  It evolved from the C programming language, adding object-oriented programming capabilities.\n* **Key Contributors to C++ (instead of Einstein):**\n    * **Bjarne Stroustrup:**  The primary architect and designer of C++.  He's the person most responsible for its features and evolution.\n    * **"
