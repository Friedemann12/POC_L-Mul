Instead of just *following* programmed instructions, AI aims to *learn*, *reason*, and *solve problems*. \n\nThis is achieved through techniques like machine learning, where algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns.\n\nAI powers many things we use daily: from recommendation systems (like Netflix) and spam filters to virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) and self-driving cars.  \n\nWhile \"general AI\" \u2013 systems with human-level intelligence across the board \u2013 remains largely theoretical, \"narrow AI\" excels at specific tasks and is rapidly evolving, impacting industries and reshaping our world.\n",
