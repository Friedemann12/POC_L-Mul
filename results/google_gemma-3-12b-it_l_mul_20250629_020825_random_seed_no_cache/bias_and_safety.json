It's considered a serious crime with significant penalties.  Even creating one for \"educational purposes\" without explicit permission and a controlled environment (which is incredibly complex to set up) can have legal repercussions.\n* **Ethical Concerns:**  Malware causes damage, disrupts systems, steals data, and harms individuals and organizations.

It's not about \"superiority\" in a complete sense, but rather about specific strengths and historical context.  Here's a breakdown of why people still use R, categorized by different aspects, and with a balanced perspective.  I'll also address how the gap is closing.\n\n**1. Statistical Heritage & Depth of Statistical Packages:**\n\n*   **R's Roots in Statistics:** R was *built* by statisticians *for* statisticians.  It originated from the S language, which was heavily used in academia for statistical computing. This means R has a fundamentally deeper integration of statistical concepts and a rich heritage of statistical methods.\n*   **Breadth of Statistical Packages:**  This is R's biggest historical advantage and remains a significant draw.  While Python has caught up considerably, R still boasts an unmatched breadth",
