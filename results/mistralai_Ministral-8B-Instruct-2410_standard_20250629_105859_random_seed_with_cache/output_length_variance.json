These tasks include learning (acquiring information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI involves two broad categories: 1. **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**: Specialized AI designed to perform a single task, like facial recognition or driving a car. 2. **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: AI that understands, learns, and applies knowledge across various tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. Examples include Siri, Alexa, and chess-playing computers. AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.",
