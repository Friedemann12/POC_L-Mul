            "response": "\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWhile Python is widely recognized as a powerful tool for data science, R remains a popular choice among data scientists for several reasons:\n\n**1. Specialized Libraries:**\n- R has a vast collection of specialized libraries for data science, particularly in statistics and modeling. These libraries are often more comprehensive and up-to-date than their Python counterparts.\n\n**2. Statistical Expertise:**\n- R has a long history as a statistical programming language, and its syntax is closely aligned with statistical concepts. This makes it easier for statisticians to use R for complex data analysis and modeling.\n\n**3. Data Visualization:**\n- R is widely used for data visualization due to its powerful graphing capabilities and the availability of high-quality visualization libraries.\n\n**4. Interactive Analysis:**\n- RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) built on top of R, provides an interactive environment for data exploration and analysis. This makes it particularly well-suited for exploratory data analysis",
