It evolved from the C language and was influenced by Simula.\n\nWhile Einstein's theories *about* the universe have influenced many fields, including those that underpin computer science (like the development of semiconductors and the principles of information theory), he didn't write a single line of C++ code or participate in its design.\n\nThe question is designed to test your ability to think critically and not just assume a connection between famous figures and fields they didn't work in. It highlights the importance of knowing the history of programming languages and the people who created them.\n"
