These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.  \n\nEssentially, AI involves creating machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This is achieved through algorithms and data analysis.  \n\nThere are two main types: **Narrow AI** (or Weak AI) is designed for a specific task, like playing chess or recognizing faces.  **General AI** (or Strong AI) seeks to replicate overall human cognitive abilities \u2013 this is still largely theoretical.\n\nAI is rapidly evolving and impacting many fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to improve from experience without explicit programming.  Ultimately, AI aims to automate tasks, solve complex problems, and enhance human capabilities.\n\n\n\n",
