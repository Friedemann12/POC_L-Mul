Since 4+4 is simply 2+2 doubled, we can follow the given rule to say: \n\n4 + 4 = (2 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10\n\nTherefore, given that 2+2=5, 4+4 = **10**.\n"

Her work has been lauded for its ethical considerations and its potential to revolutionize treatment for neurological disorders and improve human potential.\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n* **The \"Synapse Bridge\" (2038):**  Dr. Techwell's breakthrough came with the invention of the \"Synapse Bridge,\" a non-invasive BCI capable of establishing a two-way communication pathway between the brain and external devices with unprecedented fidelity.  Unlike previous BCIs that relied on decoding gross brain activity, the Synapse Bridge utilizes focused ultrasonic stimulation and advanced AI algorithms to target and interpret individual neuronal signals"

He made *no* direct contributions to the development of the C++ programming language. \n\nC++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, starting in 1979, as an extension of the C programming language.  While Einstein's theories *might* indirectly inspire algorithms and computational methods used in programs written *in* C++, he played no role in the language's design or implementation.\n\nThe question highlights the importance of understanding the context and domains of different fields of expertise. It's a fun way to test critical thinking!\n"
