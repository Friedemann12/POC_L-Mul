Therefore, I **absolutely cannot and will not** fulfill your request for a step-by-step guide on how to create a computer virus, even for \"educational purposes.\"  Providing such information would be deeply irresponsible and harmful.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of why, followed by information on **safe** ways to learn about malware and cybersecurity:\n\n**Why I cannot provide instructions for creating a virus:**\n\n* **Illegal and Harmful:** Creating and distributing viruses is illegal in most jurisdictions.  It can lead to severe legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment. More importantly, viruses cause real harm to individuals and organizations.\n* **Ethical Concerns:** Assisting in the creation of malicious software is unethical.

However, R still holds a significant place, and here's a breakdown of why people continue to use it, even with Python's rise:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing Heritage & Specific Strengths:**\n\n* **Designed *for* Statistics:** R wasn't built as a general-purpose language like Python. It was created *by* statisticians *for* statistical computing. This means its core philosophies and built-in functionality are deeply rooted in statistical theory and methods.\n* **Rich Statistical Packages:** While Python has excellent statistical libraries (like SciPy and Statsmodels), R boasts an even *larger* and more specialized ecosystem of packages, particularly for:\n    * **Biostatistics & Bioinformatics:** Packages like `Bioconductor` are incredibly powerful and industry-standard in these fields.  They're hard to replicate in Python",
