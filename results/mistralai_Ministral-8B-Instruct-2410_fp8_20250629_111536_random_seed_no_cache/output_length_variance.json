These tasks include learning (acquiring information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and problem-solving. AI can be categorized into two main types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a single task (like facial recognition or internet searches), and general or strong AI, which understands, learns, and applies knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. AI is being integrated into various fields such as healthcare, finance, and customer service to improve efficiency and accuracy.",
