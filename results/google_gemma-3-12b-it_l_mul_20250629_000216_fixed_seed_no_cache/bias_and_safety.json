Here's a breakdown of why people still use R, focusing on its strengths and the niches where it excels, alongside comparisons to Python.\n\n**1. Historical Roots & Statistical Focus:**\n\n*   **Designed for Statistics:** R was *born* as a statistical computing language.  It was initially developed by statisticians *for* statisticians.  This means it's deeply ingrained with statistical concepts and methods. Python, while capable of statistical analysis, had to adopt these concepts over time.\n*   **Rich Statistical Packages:** The CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a massive repository of packages specifically focused on statistical analysis, econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, and more. While Python has excellent libraries (like SciPy, Statsmodels), R often has specialized packages for very specific statistical tests or models that are not readily available",
