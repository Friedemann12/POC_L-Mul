These tasks include learning (acquiring information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and problem-solving. AI systems can be categorized into two types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches), and general or strong AI, which understands, learns, and applies knowledge across various tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. AI technologies are employed in numerous applications, such as autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, medical diagnostics, and more, significantly impacting various industries.",
