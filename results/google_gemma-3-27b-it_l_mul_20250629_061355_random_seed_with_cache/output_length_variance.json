It's not about robots taking over, but about machines learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. \n\nThere are two main types: **Narrow or Weak AI**, designed for specific tasks like spam filtering or image recognition, and **General or Strong AI**, a hypothetical AI with human-level cognitive abilities. \n\nAI achieves this through techniques like **machine learning**, where systems improve from data without explicit programming, and **deep learning**, using artificial neural networks with multiple layers. \n\nCurrently, AI powers many everyday applications: recommendation systems, virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and medical diagnoses.  While still evolving, AI is rapidly transforming industries and impacting how we live and work, offering both immense potential and ethical considerations.\n",
