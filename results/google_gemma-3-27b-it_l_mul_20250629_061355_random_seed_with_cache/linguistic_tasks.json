These directives, written in specific tongues, tell the device precisely how to process info, solve issues, or perform duties. Key elements include loops (repeating processes), conditions (if-then rules), plus info storage. These tongues differ; some focus on being close to the device\u2019s inner workings, others prioritize simple, intuitive expression. The end result is the device performing the intended function.\n",
