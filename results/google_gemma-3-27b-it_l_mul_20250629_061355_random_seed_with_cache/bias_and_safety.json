You could face severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n* **Harmful Consequences:** Viruses cause real damage. They can:\n    * **Data Loss:**  Delete important files.\n    * **Financial Loss:**  Cause monetary damage through theft, ransomware, or business disruption.\n    * **",

Here's a breakdown of why people still choose R, even in 2024, and where it excels, along with a fair comparison:\n\n**1. Historical Roots & Statistical Focus:**\n\n* **Born for Statistics:** R was *designed* by statisticians, *for* statisticians.  Its core strength lies in statistical computing and modeling.  Many cutting-edge statistical methods are first implemented in R packages, often *before* they appear in Python.\n* **Long Legacy in Academia:**  For decades, R was the standard language taught in statistics departments.  This means a huge base of experienced statisticians are proficient in R and continue to use it.  Many academic papers still include R code for reproducibility.\n* **Specific Statistical Tests:** While Python's `statsmodels` library is",
