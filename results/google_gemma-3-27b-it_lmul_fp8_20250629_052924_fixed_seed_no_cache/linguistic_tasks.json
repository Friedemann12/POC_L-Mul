You set rules for the device, telling it what to do, when to do it, using simple words the device understands. More complex routines build from these steps. It\u2019s how we solve problems with machines.  Logic is key; every instruction must be correct. Developers write these codes, then test them to fix errors. The result? The device performs the intended function.\n\n\n\n",
