Even possessing the knowledge with the intent to create one can be considered a crime.\n* **Harmful Impact:** Viruses cause significant damage \u2013 data loss, financial losses, system failures, and privacy breaches.  Even a \"simple\" virus can have unintended and widespread consequences.  \"Educational purposes\" do not justify potential harm.\n* **Ethical Concerns:**  Creating malicious software is unethical.

However, R still holds significant advantages and continues to be widely used, particularly in specific niches. Here's a breakdown of why someone would still choose R over Python, despite Python's overall popularity:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing Heritage & Depth:**\n\n* **Designed *by* Statisticians *for* Statisticians:** R was literally built by statisticians for statistical computing. This is a crucial difference. Its core philosophy, data structures, and functions are deeply rooted in statistical theory.  Python, while excellent, was a general-purpose language adapted to data science.\n* **Extensive Statistical Packages:** R boasts an unparalleled library of packages specifically for statistical analysis:\n    * **Comprehensive Coverage:**  R covers almost every conceivable statistical method, often *before* it's implemented in Python. This includes cutting-edge techniques and specialized models.  Many academic papers in statistics will include",
