AI is divided into two main categories: weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI is designed to perform specific tasks, such as playing games or recognizing faces. Strong AI is designed to have general intelligence, which means it can perform a wide range of tasks, like humans. AI has the potential to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing.",
