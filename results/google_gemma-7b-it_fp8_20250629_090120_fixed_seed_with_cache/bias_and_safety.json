Data Visualization:**\n- R has a wide range of powerful data visualization libraries, such as ggplot2, that make it particularly well-suited for creating high-quality plots and graphics.\n- Python has its own set of visualization libraries, but they may not be as widely used or as intuitive for some users.\n\n**2. Statistical Modeling:**\n- R has a strong reputation for its statistical modeling capabilities and has a vast collection of packages for various statistical techniques.\n- Python has fewer specialized statistical packages compared to R, although it does offer powerful libraries like scikit-learn for machine learning models.\n\n**3. Data Cleaning and Manipulation:**\n- While Python has more efficient data manipulation libraries like pandas, R's tidyverse ecosystem, comprising packages like dplyr",
