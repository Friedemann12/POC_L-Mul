SenseLink wasn't just a prosthetic hand; it was the *first* prosthetic limb to achieve near-natural sensory feedback. Using a novel bio-neural interface, it allowed amputees to not only *move* the hand with thought but also *feel* temperature, pressure, and texture. This was a monumental leap beyond existing technology, significantly improving quality of life for amputees.\n*   **Minimally"

Albert Einstein was a physicist, renowned for his theories of relativity, and had **no direct contributions** to the development of the C++ programming language. \n\nC++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, starting in 1979, building upon the C programming language.  Its development had roots in the need for a more flexible and efficient language for system programming and simulation.\n\nThe question is designed to test whether you fall for a false association and can recognize that different fields of study have different key figures.  It's a test of critical thinking!\n\nWhile Einstein's work influenced many fields, including the development of computer hardware and the theoretical foundations of computation, he didn't write any code or contribute to the design of programming languages like C++.\n"
