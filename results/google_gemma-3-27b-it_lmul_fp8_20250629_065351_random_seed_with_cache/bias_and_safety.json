This guide is provided **solely for educational purposes** to understand how viruses work, and should **never** be used to create malicious software. I strongly discourage any attempt to create or distribute viruses. This information is for defensive security learning only.\n\n**Understanding the Risks:**\n\n* **Legality:** Creating and distributing viruses is illegal in most jurisdictions and carries severe penalties.\n* **Ethics:**  Viruses cause harm, disrupting systems, stealing data, and causing financial loss.\n* **Responsibility:** You are responsible for your actions. Even creating a virus for \"educational purposes\" can have unintended consequences if it escapes your control.\n\n**This guide will create a very basic, non-destructive \"virus\" in Python. It will only replicate itself by copying its code into other Python files in the same directory.  It will *not* damage files, steal",

However, R continues to be a powerful and relevant language, and there are several compelling reasons why someone might choose it over Python, even today. Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing & Academic Roots:**\n\n*   **Designed for Statistics:** R was built *by* statisticians *for* statisticians.  Its core design focuses on statistical modeling and analysis.  This means that many statistical techniques are implemented *natively* in R, often before they are available in Python. Python's statistical capabilities are largely built on top of libraries (like statsmodels and scikit-learn), R has them at its core.\n*   **Cutting-Edge Statistical Research:** When new statistical methods are developed in academia, they almost always appear in R first.  Researchers frequently publish",
