We use code, special symbols, plus keywords, to form these recipes. These recipes resolve issues, provide responses, or even control devices. The process involves thinking logically, breaking down complex issues into tiny, manageable steps. It's like building with blocks; simple blocks form huge structures. The result is precise, reliable control over electronic devices.\n",
