First, think about synonyms for common terms. Instead of \"programming,\" maybe \"coding\" or \"scripting.\" But wait, \"coding\" has a 'c', which is okay. Let me check each word.\n\nStart with the basics. \"Computer programming involves creating sets of instructions for machines to follow.\" Replace \"involves\" with \"entails\" or \"requires.\" \"Creating\" is okay. \"Sets of instructions\" \u2013 maybe \"sequences of commands.\" \"Machines\" can stay. \"To follow\" \u2013 \"to execute\" or \"to process.\"\n\nNext",
