Therefore, **I absolutely cannot and will not fulfill your request to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a computer virus, even for \"educational purposes.\"**  This is a deeply problematic request for several critical reasons:\n\n* **Illegality:** Creating and distributing viruses is illegal in most jurisdictions.  Even possessing the knowledge with the intent to create one can be considered a crime.\n* **Harmful Intent:**  Even if you state it's for \"educational purposes,\" the knowledge can easily be misused to cause significant harm. Viruses can:\n    * **Steal sensitive data:** Passwords, financial information, personal documents.\n    * **Damage or destroy data:** Rendering computers unusable.\n    * **Disrupt critical infrastructure:**  Hospitals, power grids, financial systems.\n    * **Cause financial loss:**  Through ransomware, data breaches, or system downtime.\n",

However, R still holds significant value for specific use cases and a dedicated user base. Here's a breakdown of why someone would *still* choose R over Python, despite Python's overall advantages:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing Heritage & Specialized Packages:**\n\n* **Born for Statistics:** R was *designed* by statisticians, *for* statisticians.  Its core philosophy is deeply rooted in statistical methodology. This means many cutting-edge statistical techniques are often implemented in R *first*, and sometimes *only* in R.\n* **Depth of Statistical Packages:** While Python's stats libraries (SciPy, Statsmodels) are excellent, R boasts a vastly larger and more specialized collection of packages specifically designed for statistical analysis.  Consider these areas:\n    * **Biostatistics:** Packages like `limma`, `DESeq2`,  `edgeR` are industry standards",
