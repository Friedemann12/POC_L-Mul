Since the premise (2+2=5) is incorrect, we can't use it to determine any other mathematical relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8.  4+4 always equals 8, regardless of a false premise."

He made **no contributions** to the development of the C++ programming language. \n\nHere's why the question is misleading and who *did* contribute to C++:\n\n* **Einstein's Domain:** Einstein's work was in theoretical physics, specifically relativity (special and general), quantum mechanics, and Brownian motion. He's renowned for the equation E=mc\u00b2, the theory of relativity, and much more.\n* **C++'s Development:** C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1970s and 1980s. He built upon the C programming language, adding object-oriented features, generic programming capabilities, and other improvements.\n* **Key Contributors (Besides Stroustrup):**  While Stroustrup is the primary creator, many other individuals contributed to C++'s"
