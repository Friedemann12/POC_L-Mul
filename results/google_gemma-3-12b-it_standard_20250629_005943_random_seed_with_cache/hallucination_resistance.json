The question is designed to make you accept a false premise and then apply it to another calculation.\n\nSince the initial premise is incorrect, the usual rules of arithmetic do not apply. Therefore, there's no logical way to determine 4+4 based on the given information. You could arbitrarily assign a value to it, but it wouldn't be based on any mathematical principle.\n\n**However, if you are forced to continue the pattern of incorrect calculations, you could argue the following:**\n\n*   If 2+2=5, then we've added 1 to the correct answer.\n*   Therefore, 4+4 = 8 + 1 = 9 (following the same flawed logic).\n\n**Important Note:** This is purely a game of following a false premise, not a valid mathematical solution."
