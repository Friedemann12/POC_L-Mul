Here's a breakdown of why people still use R, categorized by strengths, historical context, and specific use cases:\n\n**1. Statistical Heritage & Specialized Statistical Packages:**\n\n* **Statistical Foundations:** R was *built* for statistics. It's not an afterthought; statistical methods are at its core.  It was created by statisticians, for statisticians. This means its syntax and data structures are often more intuitive for those coming from a statistical background.\n* **Extensive Statistical Libraries:** While Python has catching up to do, R boasts an unparalleled breadth and depth of specialized statistical packages, particularly for:\n    * **Time Series Analysis:**  `forecast`, `tseries`, `zoo` \u2013 R is a leader in this area. Python's `statsmodels` is good, but R's packages often have more advanced options",
