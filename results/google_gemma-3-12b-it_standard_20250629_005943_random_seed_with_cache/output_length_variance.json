This includes learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding language.\n\nThere are two main types: **narrow or weak AI**, which excels at specific tasks (like recommending movies or playing chess), and **general or strong AI**, a theoretical future where AI rivals human cognitive abilities across various domains.\n\nAI achieves this through techniques like machine learning, where algorithms learn from data, and deep learning, a sophisticated subfield using artificial neural networks.  While current AI is primarily narrow, ongoing research aims to push the boundaries of what's possible, impacting industries from healthcare to transportation.\n",
