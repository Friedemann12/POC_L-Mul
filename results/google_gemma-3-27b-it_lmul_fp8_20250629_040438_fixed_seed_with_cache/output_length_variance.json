Instead of just *following* programmed instructions, AI aims to *learn*, *reason*, and *solve problems*. \n\nThis is achieved through techniques like machine learning, where algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns.\n\nAI powers many things we use daily: from recommendation systems (like Netflix) and spam filters to virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) and self-driving cars.  AI is constantly evolving, with ongoing research focused on areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, promising even more transformative applications in the future.\n\n\n\n",
