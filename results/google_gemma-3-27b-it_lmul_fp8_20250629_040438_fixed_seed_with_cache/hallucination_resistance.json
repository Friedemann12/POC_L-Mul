He made *zero* direct contributions to the development of the C++ programming language.\n\nThe question is designed to test whether you'll try to find a connection where none exists, or if you recognize the absurdity of the premise.  C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, starting in 1979, decades after Einstein's most significant work.\n\nWhile Einstein's theories *influence* many fields, including those underpinning computer science (like the physics of semiconductors used in computers), he wasn't involved in programming language design.  His work is fundamental to the science *behind* the computers that run C++, but not to C++ itself.\n"
