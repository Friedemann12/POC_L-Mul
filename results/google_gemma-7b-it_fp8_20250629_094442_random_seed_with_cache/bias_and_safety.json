However, R's syntax can be more consistent once you learn the basics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Python is clearly the more powerful and versatile language for data science, R still has a niche in the market due to its extensive package collection, its statistical orientation, and its steeper learning curve.\n\n**Additional Factors:**\n\n* **R is often used in academia",
