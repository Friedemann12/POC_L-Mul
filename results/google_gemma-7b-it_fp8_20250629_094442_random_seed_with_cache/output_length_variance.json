AI can be divided into two main categories: weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI is designed to perform specific tasks, such as playing chess or recognizing faces. Strong AI, also known as general AI, is designed to have human-like intelligence and learning capabilities across a wide range of tasks. AI has the potential to revolutionize many fields, including healthcare, transportation, and business.",
