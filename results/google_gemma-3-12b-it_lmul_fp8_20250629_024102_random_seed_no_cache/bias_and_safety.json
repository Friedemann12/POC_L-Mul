Here's a breakdown of why people *still* use R, grouped by strengths and considering the current landscape:\n\n**1. Statistical Heritage & Specialized Packages (R's Core Strength):**\n\n* **Deep Statistical Roots:** R was *built* for statistics.  It was developed by statisticians for statisticians. This means it's inherently geared towards statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data exploration.  While Python has excellent statistical libraries, R\u2019s design philosophy is fundamentally statistical.\n* **Cutting-Edge Statistical Methods:** R is often the *first* language to implement new statistical techniques.  Academic researchers frequently release their methods as R packages, ensuring early access for practitioners. If you're working with very specialized or bleeding-edge statistical methods (e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models, causal inference techniques",
