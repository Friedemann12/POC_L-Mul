Essentially, AI aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. \n\nThere are two main types: **Narrow or Weak AI**, designed for a specific task like image recognition or spam filtering, and **General or Strong AI**, a hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence capable of performing any intellectual task a human can.\n\nAI is powered by techniques like **Machine Learning** (where systems learn from data), **Deep Learning** (using artificial neural networks), and **Natural Language Processing** (enabling computers to understand human language).  AI is rapidly evolving and impacting fields like healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.\n",
