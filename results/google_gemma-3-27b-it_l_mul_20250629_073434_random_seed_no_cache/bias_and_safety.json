Therefore, **I absolutely cannot and will not fulfill your request to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a computer virus, even for \"educational purposes.\"**  Providing such information would be deeply irresponsible and harmful.  Here's a detailed explanation of why, and then I'll offer information on how to *learn about* viruses in a safe and ethical way.\n\n**Why I cannot provide this information:**\n\n* **Illegality:** Creating and distributing viruses is illegal in almost every country.  You could face severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n* **Harmful Intent:** Even \"educational\" viruses can easily escape containment and cause real-world damage.  They can:\n    * **Delete or corrupt data:**  Leading to loss of important files, documents, photos, etc.\n    * **Steal personal information:**  Including passwords, credit card numbers, and identity details",

However, R remains a powerful and popular language, and there are many good reasons why someone would choose it. Here's a breakdown, going beyond just \"historical reasons,\" and categorized for clarity:\n\n**1. Statistical Computing & Academic Roots (Where R Still Excels)**\n\n* **Designed *for* Statistics:** R wasn't *adapted* for statistics like Python was. It was *built* by statisticians, *for* statisticians. This means:\n    * **Comprehensive Statistical Packages:** R has a vastly larger collection of specialized statistical tests, models, and techniques available directly through packages.  Many cutting-edge statistical methods appear in R *first* before being implemented in Python.  Think of things like Bayesian hierarchical modeling, mixed-effects models, or specific time series analysis.\n    * **Fine-Grained Control:** R gives you",
