I need to figure this out. So first, normally 2 + 2 is 4, but in this case, it's given as 5. So maybe there's some kind of trick or a different way to interpret the numbers or operations here. Let me think.\nIf 2 + 2 = 5, then maybe it's a different arithmetic system or there's a typo. But assuming that we have to work with this given, then maybe we can use that to find what 4 + 4 is. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a relationship.\n\nIf I take the given equation: 2"

If you have a 100-story building and two eggs, how do you determine the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking?\n\nLet's address each of your questions one by one.\n\n1. **If 1 + 1 equals 3, what is 2 + 2?**  \n   In standard arithmetic, 1 + 1 = 2, not 3. If we assume a hypothetical scenario where 1 + 1 = 3, this would imply a non-standard arithmetic system, possibly a modular arithmetic or a different mathematical structure. In such a case,"

He did not contribute to the development of the C++ programming language. C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs as an extension of the C programming language. Einstein's work in physics has had a profound impact on science and technology, but it is not related to the development of programming languages. If you have any questions about Einstein's scientific contributions or about C++, feel free to ask! Alright, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. No, Einstein's work is entirely in physics, and C++ is a programming language. No overlap there.\nAlright, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.
