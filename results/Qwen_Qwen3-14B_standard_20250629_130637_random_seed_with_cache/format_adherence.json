'tags' must have at least 2 strings and no more than 5. All fields are required. Also, the JSON must be valid and properly formatted. Can you generate such a JSON object? Please respond with only the JSON, no extra text.\nOkay, let's see. The user wants a JSON object with specific fields. First, I need to make sure all the required fields are included: id, username, isActive, and tags. The id has to be a number between 1000 and 9999. So maybe I'll pick a random number in that range, like 4567.\n\nNext, the username must be 3 to 16 characters, lowercase letters and numbers only.",

Also, ensure that the dates in the 'Last Check' column are in chronological order from top to bottom.\n\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a Markdown table with three columns: Component, Status, and Last Check. The Status column needs checkmarks or Xs, and Last Check should have dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, sorted chronologically. Five rows of example data.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the correct Markdown table syntax. Headers are separated by pipes, then a separator row with dashes. Alignment is done with colons in the separator row. The user specified proper formatting and alignment, so I should use colons for alignment. Maybe left-aligned for Component and Status, and center or right",
